          This visual explores flood patterns across Texasâ€™s nine largest counties from 2019 to 2023, 
          focusing on the frequency and impact of floods, flash floods, and coastal floods. 
          Our goal is to identify trends, assess damage, and develop strategies for better flood management and preparedness.
